# ==============================
# 1. GCP / Bucket configuration
# ==============================

# Primary GCS bucket that contains the "content/..." tree.
# This MUST match where you uploaded ./gcs_content_root from generate_test_ammo.py
bucket: "content-deployment-lab-01"

# Internal alias used inside the role (don't change unless you know what you're doing)
aip_cs_bucket: "{{ bucket }}"

# GCP project: reuse aip_gcp_project if it is already defined elsewhere
# (e.g. in group_vars or by another role), otherwise fall back to the lab project.
aip_cs_gcp_project: "{{ aip_gcp_project | default('deployment-setup-lab-01') }}"

# Controller-side temp root for AIP content builds (on Ansible Hub)
aip_cs_controller_tmp_root: "/tmp/aip_content"


# ==========================================
# 2. Jetson deployments / state directories
# ==========================================

# Root where AIP deployments live on the Jetson.
# Your docker-compose stacks and app live under here.
aip_deploy_root: "/home/checkout/deployments"

# Linux user that owns the deployment tree and receives files from Ansible
aip_deploy_user: "checkout"

# AIP state roots (created by jetson_aip_prereqs / jetson_app_stack roles)
aip_state_root: "/opt/aip/state"

# Staging area where new bundles are rsynced before promotion
aip_state_stage_dir: "{{ aip_state_root }}/stage"

# Backup root where previous versions of bundles are stored
aip_state_backups_dir: "{{ aip_state_root }}/backups"

# Receipts for completed/failed content sync operations
aip_state_receipts_dir: "{{ aip_state_root }}/receipts"


# =========================
# 3. Content bundle identity
# =========================

# bundle_id is REQUIRED at runtime (passed via -e or inventory).
# Examples:
#   "global-settings-v1"   (Scenario 1)
#   "summer-promo"         (Scenario 2)
#   "broken-update-v99"    (Scenario 3)
bundle_id: ""

# bundle_type is OPTIONAL.
# If not set, the role derives it from the manifest path:
#   gs://<bucket>/content/<bundle_type>/<bundle_id>/manifest.yml
# so bundle_type will be "config", "ad", "ui", "features", etc.
bundle_type: ""


# ==============================
# 4. Targeting / gating slugs
# ==============================

# These are used to resolve override paths and gating rules:
#   overrides/region/{region_slug}
#   overrides/store/{region_slug}/{warehouse_slug}/{store_slug}
#   target.regions / target.stores / target.devices in manifest.target
region_slug: ""
warehouse_slug: ""
store_slug: ""
device_slug: ""


# =====================
# 5. Behaviour switches
# =====================

# Strict mirror flag for destination path:
#
# - If false:
#     Only surgically remove files that were previously managed by this bundle
#     (based on .aip-managed-<bundle_id>.json) but are not present in the new plan.
#
# - If true:
#     Strict mirror of dest_root: delete any files under dest_root that are
#     NOT in the current new_files list (Scenario 2: "summer-promo").
#
# You normally override this per-run with:
#   -e "prune_extraneous=true"
prune_extraneous: false

# Logical version label appended to staging / backup dir names.
# For content we usually just use "current", giving:
#   stage/<bundle_id>@current
#   backups/<bundle_id>/<timestamp>/
target_version: "current"

# Whether to execute docker compose post-actions as described in manifest.post
# (e.g. restarting frontend/state_manager) after a successful sync.
# If no post section is present in the manifest, this does nothing even if true.
aip_compose_refresh_after_sync: true

# Dry run mode:
#
# - If true:
#     Resolve manifest, build overlay on controller, and plan the changes,
#     but DO NOT touch the Jetson filesystem (no staging, no promote, no backups).
#
# - If false:
#     Perform full staging, checksum verify, backup, promote and post-actions.
aip_content_dry_run: false
